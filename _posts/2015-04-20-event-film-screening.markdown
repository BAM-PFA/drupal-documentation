The "Event/Film Screening Object" content type is for records that represent an actual event that is taking place, most often at the museum. Film Screenings are the individual events that comprise a "Film Series", and an "Event" is the equivalent for "Event Series".

There are three types of Film Screenings: Single Feature, Double Feature, and Program of Shorts, which all vary slightly in how they are displayed, and what data needs to be entered for each one.
