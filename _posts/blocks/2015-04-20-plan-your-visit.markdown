The "Plan Your Visit" Block displays on pages that are about exhibitions/screenings/etc that can be attended.

It can just contain general gallery/theater hours, location, etc. 

Eventually, it could contain information relevant to that event (i.e. hours that the box office is open, if it is a film screening), or be affected by the "location" of an event and show relevant info (address of offsite location, etc).
