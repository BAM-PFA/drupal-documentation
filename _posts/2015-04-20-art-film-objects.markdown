The "Art/Film Object" content type is for records of individual Art and Film objects in the BAM/PFA Collection. The information was previously stored in various database, which were consolidated ito a single content type in Drupal. This is helpful in some ways, but also presents some challenges since often times the information has to be displayed in distinct ways based on whether it is an "Art"
object or a "Film" object.
