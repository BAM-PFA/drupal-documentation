summary: Describes the functionality and display of an In-person component of an event/film-screening 
---

The "In-person component" of an event describes the portion of an event that involves a live component, such as a guest speaker, Q&A with a director, etc. This information displays on the event page itself, as well as elsewhere on the site.

On an event/screening page, the In-person component information is stored in a field collection (<code>field_in_person_component</code>) that contains the majority of necessary information for display. Other information is brought in from the record of the Related Person.

In-person Components also have a marketing layer, which will be used when it is being referenced elsewhere other than the event/screening page to which it belongs.

* <code>field_in_person_marketing_headli</code>
* <code>field_in_person_marketing_blurb</code>
* <code>field_in_person_marketing_image</code>

The In-person Component will appear:

* On an individual event record
* On the homepage, under "In Person"
* On the "In Person" page
* On the page of the person whos is appearing
