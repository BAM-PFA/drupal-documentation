This page will display various top level information about the site, what powers it, etc.

###Pantheon

The site is hosted on Pantheon, and hopefully adheres very closely to the [pantheon workflow](https://pantheon.io/docs/articles/sites/code/using-the-pantheon-workflow/).

###ZURB Foundation 

The site uses [ZURB Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) as the starting point for front end layout, user interface, etc.

###AWS S3
Image hosting is handled via [AWS S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc2=h_l3_sc). Images are uploaded to Drupal as usual, but after being processed are sent to AWS using the [AmazonS3 module](https://www.drupal.org/project/amazons3).
